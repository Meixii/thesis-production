# Requirements

This document lists the project requirements. 

## Backend Architecture

### 1. ORM and Data Modeling
*   **1.1. Sequelize Usage:** The backend will utilize Sequelize as an Object-Relational Mapper (ORM) for database interactions with a PostgreSQL (or similar relational) database.
*   **1.2. Model Definition:**
    *   Clear and well-defined Sequelize models will be created for each database entity (e.g., `User`, `Section`, `ThesisContribution`, `SectionDues`, `Payment`, `Loan`).
    *   Models will include appropriate data types, validations (e.g., email format, non-null constraints), and associations (e.g., `User` belongs to a `Section`, `Payment` belongs to a `User`).
    *   An example `User` model structure:
        ```typescript
        interface UserAttributes {
          id: number;
          fullName: string;
          email: string;
          passwordHash: string; // Hashed
          role: 'Student' | 'FinanceCoordinator' | 'Treasurer' | 'Admin';
          sectionId?: number | null; // FK to Sections table
          emailVerified: boolean;
          // ... other relevant fields like tokens, timestamps
        }
        ```
*   **1.3. Database Migrations:** Sequelize migrations will be used to manage database schema changes in a version-controlled manner.

### 2. API Design
*   **2.1. RESTful Principles:** APIs will adhere to RESTful design principles where appropriate, using standard HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE).
*   **2.2. Role-Based Access Control (RBAC):** Endpoints will be protected based on user roles defined in the PRD. For example, only a Treasurer or Admin should be able to create Section Dues.
*   **2.3. Asynchronous Operations for Non-Critical Tasks:** For operations that do not need an immediate response to the user (e.g., sending email notifications), these should be handled asynchronously (e.g., via message queues or background workers) to improve API response times.

### 3. Database Performance
*   **3.1. Strategic Indexing:** Ensure database tables have appropriate indexes on columns frequently used in query conditions (`WHERE` clauses), `JOIN` operations, and `ORDER BY` clauses to optimize query performance. This includes primary keys, foreign keys, and columns often used for filtering or sorting (e.g., status fields, timestamps, user/section identifiers).
*   **3.2. Query Optimization:** Regularly review and optimize database queries, especially those that are complex or identified as slow-running, to ensure efficient data retrieval.

## Data Fetching and Caching Strategies

### 1. Optimized Data Retrieval (Backend)
*   **1.1. Selective Field Retrieval (Projections):** Backend APIs should allow clients to request only the specific data fields they need, minimizing payload size. Query parameters (e.g., `?fields=id,name,email`) can be used for this.
*   **1.2. Efficient Data Joining:** The backend will efficiently join and serve related data (e.g., user and their section details) to avoid N+1 query problems. Sequelize's `include` functionality will be leveraged.
*   **1.3. Pagination:** For lists of resources (e.g., users, payments), pagination will be implemented to limit the amount of data returned in a single request (e.g., `?page=1&limit=20`).

### 2. Conditional Data Fetching and Caching
*   **2.1. Backend ETag/Last-Modified Support:** The backend will support conditional GET requests using HTTP ETags or Last-Modified headers. If data has not changed since the client's last request, the server should respond with a `304 Not Modified` status.
*   **2.2. Frontend Caching:** The frontend application will implement a client-side caching mechanism (e.g., using libraries like React Query, SWR, or advanced state management features) to:
    *   Store and reuse previously fetched data.
    *   Reduce redundant API calls.
    *   Provide a smoother user experience by displaying cached data while fresh data is being fetched (stale-while-revalidate).
*   **2.3. Cache Invalidation:** Clear strategies for cache invalidation will be implemented on the frontend when data is updated (e.g., after a successful POST, PUT, or DELETE request).

## Frontend Performance and Responsiveness

### 1. Code Loading and Bundling
*   **1.1. Code Splitting:**
    *   **Route-based Splitting:** Implement route-based code splitting to ensure that users only download the JavaScript necessary for the specific page or view they are accessing.
    *   **Component-based Lazy Loading:** Employ lazy loading for larger or non-critical UI components, deferring their load until they are needed or about to enter the viewport.
*   **1.2. Tree Shaking:** Ensure the build process effectively removes unused code (tree shaking) to minimize bundle sizes.
*   **1.3. Minification:** Minify HTML, CSS, and JavaScript assets during the build process.

### 2. Asset Optimization
*   **2.1. Image Optimization:**
    *   **Compression:** Compress images (especially user-uploaded content like receipts) to reduce file sizes without unacceptable quality loss.
    *   **Modern Formats:** Utilize modern image formats (e.g., WebP) where browser support allows, with appropriate fallbacks to traditional formats (JPEG, PNG).
    *   **Responsive Images:** Implement responsive image techniques (e.g., `srcset` attribute, `<picture>` element) to serve appropriately sized images based on the user's device and screen resolution.
    *   **Lazy Loading:** Images, particularly those in lists or below the initial fold, should be lazy-loaded to improve initial page load time.
*   **2.2. Font Loading Strategy:** Optimize web font delivery (e.g., using `font-display: swap;`, preloading critical fonts, self-hosting fonts if beneficial) to prevent Flash of Invisible Text (FOIT) or Flash of Unstyled Text (FOUT) and minimize layout shifts.

### 3. Efficient UI Rendering and Interaction
*   **3.1. Virtualization for Long Lists:** For UI elements that render potentially long lists of data (e.g., transaction histories, user lists), implement list virtualization to render only the items currently visible within the viewport.
*   **3.2. Debouncing and Throttling:** Apply debouncing or throttling techniques to event handlers for frequent events (e.g., search inputs, window resizing) to limit the rate of function executions or API calls.
*   **3.3. Memoization:** Utilize memoization techniques (e.g., `React.memo`, `useMemo`, `useCallback` in React) to prevent unnecessary re-renders of components and re-computation of values.
*   **3.4. Loading State Indicators:** Provide clear and consistent visual feedback (e.g., skeleton screens, spinners, progress bars) during data fetching operations or when background tasks are running, to improve perceived performance and user experience.
*   **3.5. Minimize DOM Manipulations:** While frontend frameworks handle much of this, be mindful of practices that could lead to excessive or inefficient direct DOM manipulations.
