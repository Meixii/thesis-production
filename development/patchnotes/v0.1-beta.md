# CHANGELOG for CSBANK v1.3 - v~

### Initialized @development Folder
- Created Markdown files for frontend, backend, prd, requirements, status, techstacks, and flow to structure development documentation.

### Improved CSV Export Functionality
- Added Reference ID column to the exported payment status CSV
- Added Payment Method column to track how payments were made
- Added summary section with totals at the bottom of exported CSVs:
  - Total amount paid
  - Subtotals by payment method (GCash, Cash, Maya, Others)
- Improved date formatting in exports to show time and date in a cleaner format (e.g., 12:01PM 05/14/2025)
- Removed timezone information from exported dates for better readability

### Improved Receipt Viewing Experience
- Changed receipt viewing from opening in a new tab to displaying in a modal
- Added a modal that shows the receipt image when "View" is clicked
- Included an option to open the receipt in a new tab from within the modal if needed
- Improved user experience by keeping users on the same page while viewing receipts

### Improved Thesis Weeks Edit Modal UX
- Edit modal now pre-fills all fields (week number, start date, end date, group) with the current values when editing a week.
- Users can now edit only the desired field (e.g., just the group) without re-entering all fields.
- Added a Reset button to revert changes in the modal to the original values.
- Added validation and error messages for required fields.
- Added a loading state for the update button and success/error feedback.

### Table Date Display and Add/Edit Consistency
Table dates are displayed using a manual formatter (M/D/YYYY), never new Date(), preventing timezone-related shifts.
Add/Edit thesis weeks now always use and submit plain yyyy-mm-dd strings, never Date objects or ISO strings, ensuring the date in the DB matches the user's selection.

## Reviewed SQL for Neon Compatibility and Import Order
- Reviewed the `backend/src/config/csd.sql` file.
- Added missing ENUM type definitions required for successful execution (user action).
- Pointed out and subsequently commented out redundant `CREATE UNIQUE INDEX` statements for primary keys and named unique constraints to improve script clarity and maintainability.
- Reordered `CREATE TABLE` statements to respect foreign key dependencies, ensuring a smoother database import process.
- Confirmed overall standard PostgreSQL syntax compatibility with Neon.

### Enhanced Tech Stack Documentation
- Updated `development/techstacks.md` to provide a comprehensive overview of frontend, backend, and deployment technologies.
- Incorporated key dependencies and their versions from `package.json` files for both frontend and backend.
- Improved structure and readability for better understanding of the project's architecture.

### Updated Product Requirements Document (PRD)
- Restructured and significantly expanded `development/prd.md`.
- Populated the PRD with detailed information derived from `development/README.md`, covering introduction, goals, user roles, product features, key rules, and non-goals.

### Updated Project Status Document
- Revamped `development/status.md` for the CSBank project.
- Document now reflects completion of the planning phase and outlines next steps based on `README.md` and `DEVELOPMENT_CHECKLIST.md`.
- Summarizes current status of major development areas as "Not Started" and lists immediate focus on core setup and authentication.
