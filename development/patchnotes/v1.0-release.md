# CHANGELOG for CSBANK v1.0-release - v~

## v1.0-release (Ongoing)

### Fixed Frontend CORS Policy Error
*   **Title:** Resolved Cross-Origin Resource Sharing Configuration Issue
*   **Details:**
    *   **Issue:** Frontend hosted at `https://www.zgkaizen.xyz` was blocked by CORS policy when accessing backend API at `https://thesis-production-production.up.railway.app`
    *   **Error Message:** "Access to fetch at 'https://thesis-production-production.up.railway.app/api/auth/login' from origin 'https://www.zgkaizen.xyz' has been blocked by CORS policy: Response to preflight request doesn't pass access control check: No 'Access-Control-Allow-Origin' header is present on the requested resource."
    *   **Secondary Issue:** 502 Bad Gateway errors on OPTIONS requests after initial CORS configuration
    *   **Root Causes:** 
        *   The `FRONTEND_URL` environment variable on Railway backend deployment did not include the production frontend domain
        *   Session cookie domain was restricted to `.railway.app` which prevented cross-origin session handling from `www.zgkaizen.xyz`
    *   **Solutions Applied:** 
        *   Updated Railway environment variable `FRONTEND_URL` to include `https://www.zgkaizen.xyz` in comma-separated list
        *   Removed session cookie domain restriction by setting `domain: undefined` for cross-origin compatibility
        *   Added enhanced logging for OPTIONS requests to aid future debugging
    *   **Code Changes:**
        *   Modified session configuration in `backend/src/app.js` to remove domain restriction
        *   Enhanced OPTIONS request handler with origin logging
    *   **Impact:** Frontend can now successfully authenticate and make API calls to backend without CORS or 502 errors

### Requirements & Backend Strategy Update (v1.3)
*   **Title:** Defined Backend Architecture and Data Fetching Requirements
*   **Details:**
    *   Added requirements for using Sequelize ORM for data modeling (e.g., `User` model).
    *   Specified the need for optimized data retrieval (projections, efficient joins, pagination).
    *   Outlined requirements for conditional data fetching using ETags/Last-Modified headers (backend) and client-side caching strategies (frontend).
    *   These additions aim to establish a clear direction for building a scalable and performant backend.

### Enhanced Performance & Optimization Requirements (v1.3)
*   **Title:** Expanded Performance and Responsiveness Requirements
*   **Details:**
    *   **Frontend:** Added requirements for code splitting (route & component), lazy loading (images, components), advanced asset optimization (image formats, responsive images, font loading), UI rendering efficiencies (list virtualization, debounce/throttle, memoization), and consistent loading state indicators.
    *   **Backend:** Included requirements for strategic database indexing, query optimization, and asynchronous processing for non-critical tasks (e.g., notifications).
    *   **Network:** Specified the use of CDNs for static assets, server-side compression (Gzip/Brotli), and leveraging modern HTTP protocols (HTTP/2, HTTP/3).
    *   These enhancements further detail the strategies to ensure CSBank is a highly optimized and responsive application.

### Fixed Treasurer Endpoints Database Schema Issues (v1.4)
*   **Title:** Resolved 500 Internal Server Errors in Treasurer Functionality
*   **Details:**
    *   **Issue:** Treasurer endpoints `/api/treasurer/dues` and `/api/treasurer/checklists` were failing with 500 errors due to missing database tables.
    *   **Root Cause:** The application code referenced checklist tables (`checklists`, `checklist_items`, `checklist_student_status`) and enum types (`user_due_status`, `checklist_item_status`, `checklist_student_item_status`) that were not defined in the database schema.
    *   **Resolution:** 
        *   Created migration file `005_add_checklist_tables.sql` with proper table definitions
        *   Updated main schema file to include missing enum types and checklist tables
        *   Added proper foreign key constraints and indexes for optimal performance
    *   **Impact:** Treasurer functionality now works correctly, enabling checklist management and dues tracking features.

## Improved Thesis Weeks Edit Modal UX

## Fixed Total Collected Calculation Showing ₱0.00

### Problem Resolution
- **Issue**: "Total Collected" in the dues management detailed view was showing ₱0.00 even when students had paid amounts
- **Root Cause**: Database values were being returned as strings, causing string concatenation instead of numeric addition in reduce operations

### Backend Fixes
- **Updated getDueStatus() Function**: Added `parseFloat()` conversion with fallback to 0 for:
  - `amount_paid` field in user payment status
  - `amount`, `amount_allocated` in payment history
  - `total_amount_due` in due details
- **Ensured Data Type Consistency**: All monetary values now properly converted to numbers before being sent to frontend

### Frontend Improvements
- **Enhanced Summary Calculations**: Updated reduce operations in DuesList.tsx to use `Number()` conversion for safe arithmetic
- **Fixed Balance Calculations**: Individual row balance calculations now properly handle number conversion
- **Improved Error Handling**: All monetary calculations now gracefully handle null/undefined values with fallback to 0

### Technical Details
- **Backend Changes**: `treasurerController.js` - getDueStatus function
- **Frontend Changes**: `DuesList.tsx` - summary footer calculations and individual row balance calculations
- **Data Safety**: Added type conversion for all monetary fields to prevent string concatenation errors

### Impact
- ✅ Total Collected now shows accurate sum of all student payments
- ✅ Total Outstanding correctly calculated as difference between expected and collected
- ✅ Expected Total properly calculated as individual due amount × number of students
- ✅ Individual student balance calculations work correctly
- ✅ All monetary displays handle edge cases gracefully

## Fixed NaN Display Issue in Currency Values

### Problem Resolution
- **Issue**: "Total Collected" and "Total Amount" in various components were showing "NaN" when data was null, undefined, or empty
- **Root Cause**: Currency formatting functions didn't handle edge cases where database values could be null/undefined

### Frontend Fixes
- **Updated formatCurrency Functions**: Added null/undefined/NaN handling across all components:
  - `TreasurerDashboard.tsx`
  - `PendingPayments.tsx` 
  - `DuesList.tsx`
  - `DueDetails.tsx`
  - `ExportData.tsx`
  - `SimplePieChart.tsx`
  - `StudentDashboard.tsx`
  - `FCDashboard.tsx`
  - `LoanDisbursement.tsx`
  - `LoanManagement.tsx`
  - `MyLoans.tsx`
  - `LoanRequest.tsx`

- **Enhanced Data Processing**: Updated payment amount calculations in PendingPayments to safely handle null payment amounts

### Backend Fixes
- **Safe parseFloat Operations**: Added fallback values (|| 0) for all parseFloat operations in:
  - `getDashboardData()` function
  - `getStats()` function
  - `getPendingPayments()` function

- **Data Integrity**: Ensured all monetary values returned from API are valid numbers instead of null/undefined

### Impact
- All currency displays now show "₱0.00" instead of "NaN" when no data is available
- Improved user experience with consistent, readable currency formatting
- Eliminated confusing "NaN" displays across all financial interfaces

## Fixed Notification Bell axios Import Issue

### Problem Resolution
- **Issue**: NotificationBell.tsx component was importing axios but using fetch API, causing linter errors
- **Solution**: Removed unused axios import and ensured consistent use of native fetch API with getApiUrl() helper

### Technical Changes
- Removed `import axios from 'axios'` from NotificationBell.tsx
- All API calls in the component already used fetch with proper error handling
- Maintained existing functionality for auto-refresh notifications and mark-as-read features

## Enhanced Overdue Logic

### Fair Payment Status Logic
- **Problem Fixed**: Previously, all unpaid amounts became "overdue" after due date, penalizing students who made partial payments
- **New Logic**: Only pending (₱0 paid) payments become overdue after deadline
- **Preserved Status**: Partially paid students remain "partially_paid" even past due date
- **Impact**: More fair and accurate payment status tracking

### Technical Implementation
- **Backend Function**: Modified `updateDueStatuses()` in treasurerController.js
- **Condition Update**: Changed overdue logic to only affect completely unpaid dues
- **Status Preservation**: Maintains partial payment acknowledgment regardless of date
